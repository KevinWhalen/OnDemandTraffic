OnDemandTraffic
===============

On demand traffic text alerts.

Short and to the point: text a zip code to the Twilio based phone number 
and receive a one time traffic alert for moderate to serious incidents from 
the Bing Maps API. Also attempted to shorten the text length by using AlchemyAPI's keyword extraction.
